# meeting_planning_calendar

A simple event scheduler based on storing data in local storage.
To run open the file index.html or calendar.html in your browser. Attention! There will be no events on the first start because there is no data in local storage. To create a record, you need to click on the "new event +" button, fill out the form and click on the "Create" button. To delete a record, you need to click on the cross in the record cell. To filter out members, use the selector to the left of the "new event +" button on the calendar screen.
to edit the list of members, edit the newEvent.js file on lines 29 ... 33.
